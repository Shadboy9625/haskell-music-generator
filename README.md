## Algorithmic Music Generation in Haskell
### Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to implement algorithmic music generation in Haskell, specifically focusing on creating melodies like "Happy Birthday." Exploring the Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) angle involves leveraging functional programming paradigms, mathematical concepts for sound synthesis, and possibly showcasing a domain-specific language (DSL) for musical compositions. While similar solutions might exist, this implementation aims to demonstrate the expressive power of the functional paradigm and efficiency in music generation, differentiating itself through optimization and clarity in code design.

### Software Architecture
The software architecture follows a modular structure where components handle different aspects of music generation. Core functionalities include frequency calculation, waveform generation, and file I/O for playback. Parts of the code utilize libraries such as Data.ByteString for file operations. Testing predominantly occurs locally, utilizing Haskell's testing frameworks if applicable. The architecture doesnâ€™t involve a client-server model or databases.

### POPL Aspects
Functional Paradigm: Functional programming constructs are evident in functions like note, freq, and save, emphasizing immutable data and higher-order functions for sound synthesis.
Type System & Abstractions: Haskell's strong type system ensures correctness in musical representations and sound generation.
Recursion & List Comprehension: Use of recursion and list comprehensions to handle note sequences and waveform generation in freq function.
Monads & Effects: Monadic concepts in handling I/O operations with IO monad for file writing and external tool invocation.
Abstraction & Reusability: The code emphasizes abstraction and reusability, employing higher-order functions and polymorphic types for modularity.
Challenges Faced: Difficulties were encountered in translating musical theory into code and handling complex waveform generation while adhering to the functional paradigm.
Results and Tests Conducted
The project underwent comprehensive testing, using predefined melodies such as "Happy Birthday" for validation. Benchmarks assessed performance improvements in generating music compared to alternative approaches. Graphs and metrics illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm in aligning with the original problem statement.

### Music Generation Process

The music generation process involves the following key components:

- **Pulse**: Represents a discrete sample of the sound wave.
- **Sine Waves**: Used to generate clean and harmonic sound.
- **Attack and Release**: Adjusted to create smoother transitions at the beginning and end of each note.
- **Note Generation**: Utilizes the frequency formula to generate notes based on semitones and beats.

### Usage

To generate and play the "Happy Birthday" melody, run the following command:

```bash
stack run
```

This will generate a binary file (output.bin) containing the music and play it using ffplay.

An alternative to run if you don't have stack is: 
$ runghc Main.hs
$ ffplay -showmode 1 -f f32le -ar 48000 output.bin

### Customization

Feel free to customize the melody or create your own tunes. Modify the happyBirthday list in Main.hs to define different notes and durations.

Adjust the constants like volume, sampleRate, and beatDuration to control the overall sound characteristics.

### Results and Tests Conducted
The project underwent comprehensive testing, using predefined melodies such as "Happy Birthday" and "Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars" for validation. Benchmarks assessed performance improvements in generating music compared to alternative approaches. Graphs and metrics illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm in aligning with the original problem statement.

## Python Music Generation

This Python script generates a .wav file that plays the "Happy Birthday" song. The script uses the `math`, `wave`, and `struct` libraries to generate sine waves, write them to a .wav file, and then play the file.

To run the script, save it as `image.py` and use the following command:

```bash
python image.py
```

This will take around 30 seconds of time proving the inefficiency of python to handle functional paradigm. This will create a `output.wav` file in the same directory as the script. The file will contain the "Happy Birthday" song.

The script uses the `gen_sine_wave` function to generate sine waves for each note in the melody. The `write_wave_file` function then writes these sine waves to a .wav file. The `framerate` variable determines the sample rate of the .wav file, and the `duration` variable determines the duration of each note.

The `note_list` and `beat_list` variables define the melody. Each pair of corresponding elements in these lists represents a note and its duration. The `note_list` contains the frequencies of the notes, and the `beat_list` contains the durations of the notes.

The script then generates sine waves for each note in the melody and writes them to the .wav file. The resulting .wav file can be played using any .wav file player.

Please note that the frequencies in the `note_list` are in Hz. You can find the frequencies of common musical notes online.

## Comparison: Haskell vs. Python Solutions
### Haskell Solution:
The Haskell implementation leverages functional paradigms and strong type systems, providing several advantages over the Python solution:

Efficiency: Haskell's lazy evaluation and optimized functional constructs enable efficient sound generation, making it more suitable for handling large-scale compositions without compromising performance.

Type Safety: Haskell's strong static typing reduces the likelihood of runtime errors, ensuring correctness in musical representations and waveform generation.

Functional Paradigm: Haskell's functional paradigm allows concise and declarative code, enabling a more elegant and expressive representation of musical concepts.

Optimized Libraries: Utilization of optimized libraries for byte string manipulation (Data.ByteString) aids in efficient file I/O operations.

### Python Solution:
The Python solution provides a straightforward approach to generating sound waves but might have certain limitations:

Performance: Python's interpreter-based execution might lead to performance bottlenecks, especially when handling larger datasets or complex waveform generation.

Lack of Type Safety: Python's dynamic typing could potentially lead to runtime errors related to data type mismatches or inconsistencies.

### Why Haskell Might Be Preferred:
Efficiency and Performance: Haskell's compiled nature and optimized functional constructs make it more efficient for this task, especially in handling algorithmic music generation.

Type Safety and Robustness: The strong type system in Haskell ensures code correctness and reduces the chances of unexpected runtime errors compared to Python.
